The project is based on knowledge and findings in previous activities related to freshwater Earth observation.

Only in the winter are these sites reachable when certain requirements are met. In order to provide forest owners and forest management professionals with information about the accessibility of forested areas during the below-freezing temperature season, a forecasting tool that would provide the information on when and where the forests are accessible was developed in collaboration with leading industry companies. <a href="https://www.izm.gov.lv/sites/izm/files/frost_posteris_202008_mikc1.pdf" target="_blank">Read more (Poster in Latvian)</a> </p>

The credibility of the issued certificates is vital for the whole enterprise of certification approach. Certificates issued to operations who are in gross violation of the requirements undermine the trust of stakeholders, consumers and businesses towards the scheme and the certification approach in general. The AWD method allows to grow rice with significantly less methane emmissions and lower water usage.

                            <p>The project objective is to develop novel, automatic (with a low labour intensity) ICT-based wild animal census methodology to support decision making on sustainable wildlife management and conflict resolution among landowners, hunters and society. Despite the importance of abundance estimates, none of several ungulate monitoring methods used in Europe is satisfying in terms of cost-effectiveness and accuracy. The most commonly used ground-based counting techniques – snow tracking and drive counts – can lead to biased and/or imprecise results and are very labour intensive. Thus, there is a clear need for new, efficient, cost-effective, and reliable methods to estimate ungulate densities. Sustainable adaptive wildlife management is a potential solution for loss reduction but requires reliable information on wildlife census for evidence-based decision making. Information communication technologies (ICT) based solutions should be considered as efficient, cost-effective, and reliable option. During the project testing of effective and remote data acquisition techniques with minimal human involvement focused on unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with thermal and visible light cameras, movement-activated camera traps, passive acoustic sensor networks and GPS tracking of animals. <a href="https://www.videsinstituts.com/en/ict-based-wild-animal-census-approach/" target="_blank">Read more</a> </p>

                            <p>Development of Sentinel-2 satellite data-based service (SentiLake) for monitoring of Latvian lakes is being implemented within the ESA PECS for Latvia program. The pilot territory covers two regions in Latvia and includes more than 100 lakes larger than 50 ha. Automated workflow for selecting and processing of available Sentinel-2 data scenes for extracting of water quality parameters (chlorophyll-a and TSM concentrations) for each target water body was developed. Combination of C2X and C2RCC processors was chosen for the assessment of chl-a concentration showing the satisfactory performance - R2 = 0,82 and RMSE = 21,2 µg/l. Chl-a assessment result is further converted and presented as a lake quality class. Project results will provide supplementary data to limited in situ data for filling gaps and retrospective studies, as well as a visual tool for communication with the target audience. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020EGUGA..22.7133J/abstract" target="_blank">Read more</a> </p>

The project focuses on developing, optimizing and improving the conservation status of five EU priority grasslands in Latvia. All restoration activities are carried out within 14 Natura 2000 network sites. One of the initiatives was to develop grassland connectivity model based on the data about grassland habitats on national scale that is available in various databases and data sets that were developed by Institute for Environmental Solutions by using Sentinel-2 satellite 2017 data. This work involved remote sensing data experts, doing satellite data processing, algorithm development, the map production and data verification at first for smaller case area (100x100km, 17% of Latvia area) and later for all Latvia. <a href="https://www.vri.lv/en/restoring-eu-priority-grasslands/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

                            <p>The project WATERCHAIN helps to reduce inflows of nutrients and hazardous substances to the Baltic Sea from all types of land-based sources by using pilot watersheds and environmental technology. The project tackles both highly developed intensely populated cities as well as less developed peripheral, sparsely populated rural and island regions in pilot watersheds. <a href="https://waterchain.samk.fi/en/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

                            <p>It was necessary to adapt the current water quality evaluation algorithms in order to use them with the new OLCI sensor data while scientists expected the launch of the Sentinel-3 satellite. The project aimed to validate existing and develop improved remote sensing algorithms and methods for assessment of water quality data parameters in coastal (case-2) waters in the Baltic Sea. Simultaneous in situ and airborne data acquisition campaigns were implemented during the project. Testing of existing algorithms using Latvian archive of in situ data and MERIS satellite data was performed to see the correspondence between regular field sampling data acquired by the Latvian Institute of Aquatic Ecology and MERIS data products.  <a href="https://www.videsinstituts.com/en/scientists-acquire-field-data-in-the-gulf-of-riga/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

                            <p>An ESA-funded study was underway in Latvia prior to the launch of the Sentinel-2 satellite to simulate the MSI sensor data and create algorithms for the new satellite. To continue developing LC-LU classification algorithms specifically for Latvian user needs, researchers at the Institute for Environmental Solutions used advanced airborne hyperspectral remote sensing to simulate Sentinel-2 data. The developed algorithms will support the analysis of land cover-land use, the spread of invasive species, the dynamics of forest resources, the identification of damaged areas, wetlands, flood risk areas, and degraded ecosystems, as well as the evaluation of various aspects of biodiversity loss using satellite data. <a href="https://www.videsinstituts.com/en/simulation-of-sentinel-2-images/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
